# AES-Power-Analysis

This repository contains two python programs.
        i) One to perform the difference of means (DOM) attack on AES cipher with the help of power traces obtained through the chipwhisperer tool.
        ii) The next one performs correlation power attack (CPA) also on AES cipher again with power traces obtained from chipwhisperer.
        
 This a demonstration of Power Analysis Side Channel Attacks on the AES cipher.
