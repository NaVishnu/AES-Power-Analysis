# AES-Power-Analysis

This repository contains two python programs.<br>    
    i) One to perform the difference of means (DOM) attack on AES cipher with the help of power traces obtained through the chipwhisperer tool.<br>
    ii) The next one performs correlation power attack (CPA) also on AES cipher again with power traces obtained from chipwhisperer.<br>
    
 This a demonstration of Power Analysis Side Channel Attacks on the AES cipher.
